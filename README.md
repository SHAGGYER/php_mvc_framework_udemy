# php_mvc_framework_udemy

Hello guys,

This is Mikolaj Marciniak again. I would like to bid you welcome to my new course on how to create an advanced, your very own PHP MVC Framework, that resembles Laravel in some ways. This is the ONLY course on Udemy that takes mostly used Laravel's functionalities and makes it its own! Learn from the best!

WARNING!

This is an intermediate course, and it assumes basic PHP knowledge, along with basic MySQL knowledge. Taking this course if you are completely new to programming is NOT required.

WARNING!

You will be creating the following:

- Your very own advanced router, that will be able to handle routes such as: /api/todos/{id}/mark-complete!

- Your very own Database Query Builder and Model classes, that look like Laravel's Eloquent when using them!

- JWT Authentication with a trait, own library and middleware! Code and authenticate like a pro!

- Request and Response classes

- Your very own .env parser, so you can easily have your own .env variables!

- Return a model or collection of models just like laravel, no need to encode into JSON!

So...

If you are ready to embark on a new journey and advance your PHP and MySQL skills, this is the course for you!
